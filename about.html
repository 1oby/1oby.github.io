                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hi, I'm an 18-year-old photographer based in the beautiful county of Kent, UK. My passion for photography started at a young age, and it has grown into something I truly love and dedicate my time to.</p>
                    
                    <p>I specialize in landscape photography, capturing the stunning natural beauty that surrounds us. From rolling hills to dramatic coastlines, I love exploring Kent and beyond to find the perfect shot. I'm also a licensed drone pilot, which allows me to capture unique aerial perspectives that showcase landscapes from breathtaking heights.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cars have been another passion of mine since childhood, and this naturally evolved into automotive photography. I enjoy capturing the sleek lines, powerful presence, and intricate details that make each vehicle unique. Whether it's a classic car at a local meet or a modern supercar on the streets, I love the challenge of photographing these mechanical works of art.</p>
                    
                    <p>Photography isn't just a hobby for meâ€”it's a way to see and share the world from my perspective. Every image tells a story, and I'm always excited to capture the next one.</p>
